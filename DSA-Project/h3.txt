When so much of the information we consume comes from our social media snacking, the Reith Lectures provide a refreshing alternative: brilliant and entertaining presentations in which very clever people carefully develop their ideas and arguments.
There are so many thought-provoking Reith Lectures available online that it can be difficult to know where to start. So here are some suggestions for those of you who might find it helpful to have a steer:
1. The Emerging Mind
2. A Question of Trust
3. The End Of Age
4. Stephen Hawking on Black Holes
The Black Hole
5. Terror
6. A New Citizenship
