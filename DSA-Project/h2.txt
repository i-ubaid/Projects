It’s not vain to invest in your appearance
Be audacious
Wear something you can forget that you’re wearing
Wear comfortable footwear
Actually like what you wear
Decide on how much time and energy you have for ‘wardrobe work’
Think about the occasion
Preparation
Dress for the job you want
Separate your work clothes from your everyday clothes
Tailoring is great for an interview
